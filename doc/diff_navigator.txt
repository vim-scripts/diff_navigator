INTRODUCTION *diff_navigator*

Whenever you edit a patch (file with ft=diff), a set of commands is defined
for movement inside of the file and its edits.


                                                    *diff_navigator-commands*
COMMANDS *diff_navigator-commands*


                                                              *:DiffAnnotate*
:DiffAnnotate          Filter whole patch through `filterdiff` (part of
                       `patchutils` package), which annotates all hunks with
                       explanatory heading (without changing semantic meaning
                       of each hunk).


                                                              *:DiffShowHunk*
:DiffShowHunk          Decorate current hunk with explanatory heading
                       header.


                                                              *:DiffNextHunk*
:DiffNextHunk          Jump to the next hunk.


                                                              *:DiffPrevHunk*
:DiffPrevHunk          Jump to the previous hunk.


                                                             *:DiffSplitHunk*
:DiffSplitHunk         Splits the hunk under the cursor, fixing previous
                       hunk header to correctly reflect the situation.


                                                            *:DiffDeleteHunk*
:DiffDeleteHunk        Deletes the hunk under the cursor. It fixes all
                       hunks to have correctly changed headers.


                                                    *diff_navigator-settings*
This plugin doesn't have any settings.
